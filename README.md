EC2Instances.info was originally created by [Garret
Heaton](https://github.com/powdahound), is now hosted by
[Vantage](https://vantage.sh/) and developed by the community of contributors.

## Project status

Vantage employees are actively maintaining and hosting the site with the help of
contributors here. Improvements in the form of pull requests or ideas via issues
are welcome!

People have suggested many neat ideas and feature requests by opening issues on
this repository. We also have a [Slack
Community](https://join.slack.com/t/vantagecommunity/shared_invite/zt-oey52myv-gq4AWRKkX25kjp1UGziPTw)
for anyone to join with a devoted channel named #instances-vantage.sh.

## Running locally

First, you'll need to provide credentials so that boto can access the AWS API. [See a terraform example here](./docs/terraform/iam.tf)!
Options for setting this up are described in the [boto
docs](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/configuration.html).
Ensure that your IAM user has at least the following permissions:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["ec2:DescribeInstanceTypes", "ec2:DescribeRegions", "pricing:*"],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Running in Docker (recommended)

1. Clone the repository, if not already done:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vantage-sh/ec2instances.info
cd ec2instances.info
```

2. Build and run docker image using Docker Compose (tested with Docker Compose v2):

```bash
docker-compose up
```

4. Open [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser to see it in action.

## Detailed local build instructions

Note: These instructions are only kept here for reference, the Docker
instructions mentioned above hide all these details and are recommended for
local execution.

Make sure you have LibXML and Python development files. On Ubuntu, run `sudo apt-get install python-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libssl-dev`.

Then:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vantage-sh/ec2instances.info
cd ec2instances.info/
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
invoke build
invoke serve
open http://localhost:8080
deactivate # to exit virtualenv
```

## Requirements

- Python with virtualenv
- [Invoke](http://www.pyinvoke.org/)
- [Boto](http://boto.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
- [Mako](http://www.makotemplates.org/)
- [lxml](http://lxml.de/)

## Tips for Developing Locally

```
docker build --no-cache --build-arg AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID= --build-arg AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY= -t ec2instances.info .

docker run -it --rm --name ec2instances -v $(pwd):/opt/app --env HTTP_HOST=0.0.0.0 -p 8080:8080 ec2instances.info

docker exec -it ec2instances /bin/bash

# INSIDE CONTAINER
python3 render.py
sass --watch in/style.scss:www/style.css
```

## API Access

The data backing EC2Instances.info has recently been made available via a free
API. All you need to get started is a free API key. To get started with API
